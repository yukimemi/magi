//! Handing an open question to the chat conversation its task came from.
//!
//! A task filed by the standing chat (`Source::Agent` with
//! [`crate::queue::CHAT_NODE`], whose `run` is the conversation's id) can raise
//! a question the owner would rather talk through where the task started. The
//! owner passes it on; the chat agent either answers it with `magi answer` or
//! puts the decision points to the owner in the conversation.
//!
//! Three rules, each with a reason:
//!
//! - **One place decides.** [`origin_talk`] is the only judge of "does this
//!   question have a chat to ask"; the web view and both entry points use it.
//! - **Not a choice.** The hand-over never goes into `Question::choices` and
//!   never touches `Question::answer`: the question stays `Open`, its
//!   validation and the choice actions stay as they were.
//! - **No new seat, no new waiter.** The text is queued as a draft of the
//!   existing talk, so the chat's own turn machinery (its session, its turn
//!   gate) runs it exactly as if the owner had typed it.
